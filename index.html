      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Tyler. Some people say I'm funny (my mom and my girlfriend), some people say I'm handsome (my mom and my girlfriend), but everyone can agree on one thing: I get distracted very easily. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Houston, Texas but I'm currently living in Austin!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video games, music, and programming. I like long walks around the apartment complex, basking in the sun, and margaritas.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've always wanted to be a game developer. I also have more recently wanted to develop crowd-funded web applications that are fun or useful! When I'm older I would love to get my degree and teach game design and coding.</p>
      <h1>Where do you want to live?</h1>
      <p>I changed this question a little bit. I've always wanted to live somewhere where there is snow. Maybe Colorado or even somewhere out of the States.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have lots of ideas for web-based applications (either games or tools) that I think consumers would love. I would love to have a website that can hold all of my creations and support myself through passive income at some point.</p>
